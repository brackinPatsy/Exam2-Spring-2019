    Prompts the user for an integer using the phrase "Input Number 1, Input Number 2 etc.
    until the sentinel value of '-1' is encountered.
    Input integers are placed into a sequence until the
    sentinel value is encountered.
    After the sentinel value is encountered, the following information
    should be printed:
    The sequence that was input,
    The length of the sequence,
    The maximum value in the sequence,
    The average of the values in the sequence,
    Descriptive labels should be provided for each answer that is printed.
    You may assume that there is at least one element in the sequence.

No input validation is required.  Nothing else should be printed.

Here is a sample run, where the user input is to the right
of the colons:
    Please input integer 1:  4
    Please input integer 2:  -4
    Please input integer 3:  0
    Please input integer 4:  2
    Please input integer 5:  -2
    Please input integer 6:  -1
    The sequence that you input is:
    [4, -4, 0, 2, -2 ]
    The length of the sequence is: 5
    The maximum value in the sequence is:  4
    The average value of the sequence is: 0
